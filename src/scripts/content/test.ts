const linkedinPost=  `Most IT professionals overcomplicate email marketing from day one.After 15 years as a woman in IT and now building educational email courses for IT companies, I've learned that the best strategies are often the simplest ones.Here's what actually works:Simple tips I would give anyone who wants to start email marketing for the IT industry:1. Start with problems, not solutions.Don't lead with "We offer cloud migration services." Start with "Is your team still working overtime because of system crashes?" Problems grab attention. Solutions come later.2. Use their language, not yours. Replace "We optimize enterprise-grade infrastructure" with "We eliminate those 2 AM emergency calls." Speak human first, technical second.3. One clear ask per email Book a call OR download a guide OR schedule a demo. Never all three. Decision fatigue kills responses.4. Follow up (most people don't). 80% of IT sales happen after the 5th follow-up, but 90% of people stop after the first email. Be in the 10% who persist.The truth? You already know more than you think you do. You just need to translate your expertise into words that busy IT decision-makers actually care about.What's your biggest challenge with IT email marketing?`
